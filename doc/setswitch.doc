OVERVIEW                                                  *setswitch-overview*

	setswitch is probably the most useful plugin I've created. I wouldn't
	want to use Vim without it. Here's why:

	- setswitch allows you to run settings upon entering a window, and
	  turn them off when you leave the window. That means even settings
	  like `hlsearch` can be window local with setswitch.
	- setswitch is only limited to your imagination. It works with _any
	  setting_.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                          *setswitch-installation*

        To install 'setswitch' use any one of your favorite plugin managers.

        vim-plug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) ~
 >
        Plug 'webdavis/vim-setswitch'
<

        Manual Installation ~

        Install it in Vim 8.0, like so:
 >
        mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/start
        git clone git@github.com:webdavis/vim-setswitch.git ~/.vim/pack/start/vim-setswitch
<

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                        *setswitch-configuration*

	setswitch is user extensible, meaning that the following settings
	should take any option available in Vim/Neovim.

GLOBAL DICTIONARIES ~

g:setswitch = { filetype: ['option=value',...], }                *g:setswitch*

	Put this in your `~/.vimrc`, to set options when the cursor enters
	certain filetypes. You're probably wondering why this is needed when
	the `~/.vim/ftplugin` directory exists. Setswitch specifically
	toggles the settings you put in it off when leaving the window, and
	then back on when entering.

	Setswitch will run |set| on whatever {option=value} you put in
	`g:setswitch` if the filetype entry exists. If the filetype doesn't
	have an entry then the options in the {'all'} entry are |set|.
 >
	let g:setswitch = {
		\ { 'all': ['colorcolumn=+1', 'cursorline', 'cursorcolumn', 'relativenumber'] },
		\ { 'netrw': ['colorcolumn=', 'nocursorline', 'nocursorcolumn'] },
		\ { 'man': ['colorcolumn=', 'nocursorline', 'nocursorcolumn'] },
		\ { 'help': ['colorcolumn=', 'nocursorline', 'nocursorcolumn'] },
		\ { 'gitcommit': ['colorcolumn=+1,51', 'cursorline', 'cursorcolumn', 'relativenumber'] },
		\ }
<
	Setswitch will run
	`set colorcolumn=+1 cursorline cursorcolumn relativenumber` on all
	filetypes except the `netrw`, `man`, `help`, and `gitcommit`
	filetypes. For those filetypes their respective entries will be set.

g:setswitch_insert = { filetype: ['option',...], }        *g:setswitch_insert*

	Insert mode has it's own controller variable so that you can do unique
	things with it. It works a little different than |g:setswitch|.

	Set the following in your `~/.vimrc`, to instruct setswitch to toggle
	these settings off when entering insert mode.
 >
	let g:setswitch_insert = {
		\ 'all': ['cursorline', 'cursorcolumn', 'relativenumber'],
		\ }
<

	Setswitch will run `set nocursorline nocursorcolumn norelativenumber`
	on all filetypes when entering insert mode.

GLOBAL-LISTS ~

g:setswitch_hooks = []                                     *g:setswitch_hooks*

	`g:setswitch_hooks` takes a |List| of options instructing setswitch
	to listen for these options being set using the |OptionSet|
	autocommand. If they are set then setswitch will store the option and
	value of the option in the dictionary `s:setswitch`, by file name.

	Put this in your `~/.vimrc` to instruct setswitch to store the values
	of the following options whenever the user sets them. Whenever the
	cursor enters the window where these were set, setswitch will set
	these values even if they were globally set in another window. This
	pairs nicely with Tpope's vim-unimpaired plugin:

	let g:setswitch_hooks = ['cursorline', 'cursorcolumn',
		\ 'relativenumber', 'wrap', 'hlsearch', 'colorcolumn']

Docker                                                      *setswitch-docker*

        If you want to try setswitch out before installing it, there are
	'Dockerfile's for Arch Linux and Ubuntu, that build images of the
	operating systems, provisioned with setswitch.

        Simply run the following commands from within the project root
	directory './vim-setswitch'.

	Create image:
 >
	sudo docker build \
	    --tag vim-setswitch/archlinux \
	    --file test/docker/archlinux/Dockerfile .
<
	Enter container:
 >
	sudo docker run --rm -ti \
	    --hostname archlinux \
	    --name vim-setswitch.archlinux \
	    vim-setswitch/archlinux
<
	(Note: you may tailor the 'docker' commands to your needs. Read
	through the 'vim-setswitch/test/docker/<os>/Dockerfile's for the
	available provisions.

TESTS                                                        *setswitch-tests*

CONTRIBUTING                                          *setswitch-contributing*

        I recommend you open an issue explaining what you would like before
        submitting a patch. There is a good chance I will just take care of it
        for you.
